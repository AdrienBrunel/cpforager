cpforager documentation
==================================

Are you a scientist involved in movement ecology working with biologging data collected from central-place foraging seabirds? 

**cpforager** is a Python package designed to help you manipulate, process, analyse and visualise the biologging datasets with ease.

The main objectives of **cpforager** package are :  

1. Efficiently handle large-scale biologging datasets, including high-resolution sensor data (*e.g.* accelerometers).
2. Provide a modular and extensible architecture, allowing users to tailor the code to their specific research needs.
3. Facilitate a smooth transition to Python for movement ecology researchers familiar with other languages (*e.g.* R).
